Tic Tac Toe

This application is a fun and simple Tic Tac Toe game and allows the user to play with someone next to them. It is my first full application that is part of a Software Engineering program I attend. It is a work in progress that contiunes to allow me to be creative and work on my skills as an aspiring software developer.

Planning Story:

The first steps I took towards development was to set some wireframes on how I would like the game to visually look, pictured below. The orginal disgins we're based on moble and laptop play. Next I aquired all the parameters and documentation needed for the game to make a timeframe schedule.  I started with all the elements I was comfortable with in html and css to build the gameboard.  From there I started working on all the ligic that he game was going to require and login/sign up info. Once I had everything organized I was ready to start developing.

User Stories:

  As a user I want to sign in/up.
  As a user I want to Create a new game.
  As a user I want to play multiple games.
  As a user I want to be able to pick only availble spaces on the board.
  As a user I want to see the number of games played.
  As a user I want to see who has won the game.

Technologies Used:

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Sass
  * Javascript
  * jQuery
  * Bootstrap

Unsolved Problems:

Still need to make the game a bit more interactive and give it some more styling and a few mroe animation, like drop down menus and mutilple pages to view.
Would like to eventually make the it be able to play agianst a simple AI.
